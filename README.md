# GestureVolume
Gesture Volume is a Python project that uses computer vision to control audio volume with hand gestures. By detecting specific movements via a camera, users can adjust the volume without physical controls. This touchless system is built using OpenCV and Python, offering a unique, hands-free way to control sound levels.
